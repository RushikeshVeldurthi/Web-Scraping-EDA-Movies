# Web-Scraping-EDA-Movies
🎬 Decoding Movie Success
Exploring What Really Makes a Movie a Hit – With a Little Help From Python & Data

👋 Hey there!
- I'm Rushikesh, a final-year Computer Science student who’s passionate about data and the stories it can tell.

- This project started with a simple question I’ve often asked myself as a movie lover and aspiring data analyst:

- “What makes some movies resonate so well with audiences while others fall flat?”

- So, I decided to find out — using real-world data, Python, and a whole lot of curiosity.

📌 What This Project is About
I built a complete pipeline to collect, clean, and analyze data from a public movie review site.My goal was to discover patterns in movie success — whether that’s about genres, directors, or cast combinations
and to turn raw data into insights that could actually help filmmakers and marketers make better decisions.

This project is a mix of:

- Web scraping

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Storytelling through visuals and insights

💼 Why It’s Useful
In the entertainment world, millions are spent producing and promoting movies. Yet, many decisions are still made on gut feeling. This project shows how data can change that.
With the right tools and a curious mindset, we can:

- Spot which genres consistently get good audience ratings

- Learn how cast and directors influence success

- Make smarter, data-informed decisions in film production, streaming, and marketing

🧰 Tools I Used
Here’s my tech toolbox for this project:

Tool	Purpose
Python	               -->  My go-to for coding and analysis
Requests	             -->  To fetch movie data from the web
BeautifulSoup	         -->  To parse and extract info from HTML
Pandas	               -->  For cleaning, organizing, and analyzing the data
Matplotlib & Seaborn	 -->  For visual storytelling
Jupyter Notebook	     -->  To document everything in one place, step-by-step

📊 What I Found
A few highlights from the analysis:

- Drama, Action, and Thriller are consistently the top-performing genres

- Some directors and actors who appear frequently in successful films seem to have strong audience trust

- You don’t always need complex data — just thoughtful questions and clean insights

🗂 What’s Inside This Repo
- 📓 Decoding_Movie_Success.ipynb: A notebook with all the code, analysis, and visualizations

- 🎞 Decoding_movie_success_ppt.pptx: A presentation that summarizes everything in a neat, digestible format

💡 What I Learned
- How to scrape real-world data and structure it for analysis

- How to spot trends and turn raw data into clear, visual insights

- How to tell a story with data — not just numbers, but meaning
